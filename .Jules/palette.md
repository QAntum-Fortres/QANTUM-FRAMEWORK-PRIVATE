## 2025-01-20 - Mobile Dashboard Accessibility
**Learning:** Mobile dashboards often treat stats as separate visual elements (Icon, Value, Label) which forces screen reader users to swipe 3 times for one piece of info.
**Action:** Always group related visual elements into a single accessible container with a combined `accessibilityLabel` (e.g., "Lines of Code: 12,345").
