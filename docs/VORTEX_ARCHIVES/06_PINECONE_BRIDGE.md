# 🧠 PROJECT 06: PINECONE MEMORY BRIDGE

## AI Long-Term Memory Integration

**Role:** AI Engineer  
**Tech Stack:** Pinecone Vector DB, OpenAI Embeddings, Python/TypeScript  
**Status:** Live

---

### 📄 Executive Summary

The **Pinecone Memory Bridge** is the hippocampal layer of the VORTEX AI. It solves the "context window" limitation of LLMs by offloading historical data into a high-performance Vector Database. This allows the AI to "remember" trading patterns, news events, and strategy outcomes from weeks or months ago using Semantic Search.

### ⚡ Key Technical Achievements

#### 1. Semantic Search Retrieval

Instead of keyword matching, the system searches for "concepts". For example, querying "Bearish Divergence" retrieves all historical instances where that pattern occurred, regardless of the text used to describe it.

#### 2. Hybrid Embedding Strategy

Combines **Dense Vectors** (Semantic meaning) with **Sparse Vectors** (Keyword importance) to achieve highly accurate document retrieval.

#### 3. Real-Time Sync

Implemented a "Change Data Capture" (CDC) pipeline that automatically vectorizes and uploads new trade logs to Pinecone within 2 seconds of the event.

### 💻 Code Snippet: Vector Upsert

```typescript
// Storing Memories in High Dimensions
async function memorize(text: string, metadata: any) {
    const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({ input: text });
    
    await index.upsert({
        id: uuidv4(),
        values: embedding.data[0].embedding,
        metadata: metadata
    });
}
```

### 📊 Capacity Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Vector Count** | 1,000,000+ |
| **Dimensions** | 1536 (OpenAI) |
| **Query Latency** | 30ms (P95) |
