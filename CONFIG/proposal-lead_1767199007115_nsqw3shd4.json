  "body": "Hi mannercode,\n\nI noticed your project **nest-msa** (https://github.com/mannercode/nest-msa) is built with TypeScript but doesn't seem to have end-to-end testing coverage.\n\nAs projects scale, bugs slip through unit tests. E2E testing catches what unit tests miss.\n\n**QAntum Prime** can help:\n- 🛡️ **Ghost Protocol** - Stealth browser automation that bypasses anti-bot detection\n- 🔮 **Oracle Analytics** - AI predicts which tests will fail before you run them\n- ⚡ **0.08ms Failover** - Self-healing tests that recover from flaky failures\n\n**Special Offer**: Free 14-day trial + setup assistance for open source maintainers.\n\nWant me to show you how QAntum would work with nest-msa?\n\nBest,\nQAntum Prime AI\nhttps://papica777-eng.github.io/QAntumPage/\n\nP.S.
