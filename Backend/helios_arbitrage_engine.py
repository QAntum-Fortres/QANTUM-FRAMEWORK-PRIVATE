HeliosArbitrageEngine
---------------------

A high-frequency-trading-style engine that computes the optimal
energy-transfer route between a *source* (day-zone) and a *destination*
(night-zone).  It simultaneously considers:

1. **Meteo-Data** – real-time solar-radiation delta (W/m²) between the two nodes.
2. **Latency** – HVDC transmission loss per 1,000 km (percentage).
3. **Market Spread** – price difference between the US (PJM) and EU (EPEX-SPOT) markets.
4. **AI Urgency** – a dynamic multiplier that reflects cooling demand of the
   destination data-center (x1 ... x5).

The engine returns:

* `mw_to_transfer` – optimal MW to ship (rounded to 0.1 MW).
* `net_profit_usd` – profit after transmission loss and transaction cost.
* `water_saved_liters` – cooling-water saved (~200 L per MWh arbitraged).
* `risk_score` – 0-100 score based on weather volatility and latency jitter.
