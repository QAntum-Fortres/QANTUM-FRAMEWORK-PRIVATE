        To the Hiring Team at Patrianna LTD,
    </div>

    <p>
        I am writing to enthusiastically apply for the <strong>Middle Automation Engineer</strong> position. When I saw
        that Patrianna is looking for someone with experience in <strong>Social Gaming</strong>, <strong>Java
            Automation</strong>, and <strong>Playwright</strong>, I felt like the job description was written
        specifically for me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Coming from a background at <strong>DraftKings</strong>, I have already lived through the challenges of testing
        high-load betting platforms where accuracy is paramount and downtime is not an option. I don't just know "how to
        automate"; I know <em>what</em> to automate in a gaming environment to bring maximum value.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is how my technical arsenal aligns directly with your stack:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Java & Playwright:</strong> I have extensive expertise in building hybrid automation frameworks
            using Java Core. I switched from Selenium to <strong>Playwright</strong> early on for its speed and
            reliability in handling dynamic UI elements typical in modern betting apps.</li>

        <li><strong>Mobile & API:</strong> I have hands-on experience with <strong>Appium</strong> for automating mobile
            flows (bet slips, wallet deposits) and profound knowledge of <strong>RestAssured</strong> for backend API
            validation. I understand that the backend is the heart of the system and test it rigorously.</li>

        <li><strong>SDET Mindset:</strong> In my recent R&D work ("QAntum Vortex"), I architected complex test harnesses
            for simulating WebSocket traffic and verifying system resilience under chaos conditions. I am comfortable
            configuring <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong> and maintaining test environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I fit the "Middle" profile perfectly: I am independent enough to take a task from estimation to delivery without
        hand-holding, yet eager to learn and grow within a strong team. I understand Test Theory, I write clean,
        maintainable code, and I view QA not as a "gatekeeper" but as an efficiency enabler for the entire dev team.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am ready to bring my domain expertise and technical skills to Patrianna and contribute to your mission of
        captivating the North American market. Thank you for your time and consideration.
    </p>
