RE: APPLICATION FOR SENIOR AUTOMATION QA ENGINEER

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to formally apply for the Senior Automation QA Engineer position at Amusnet. Having reviewed your requirements for a professional adept in TypeScript, Playwright, and CI/CD, I am confident that my recent work architecting "The QAntum Empire" positions me as a uniquely qualified candidate who can deliver immediate value to your iGaming infrastructure.

I am not just a QA Engineer; I am a Systems Architect who has built a fully autonomous, 13-module ecosystem from the ground up. My experience goes beyond writing test scripts—I design self-sustaining quality assurance systems used to validate high-frequency trading engines and distributed microservices.

Why I am the strategic fit for Amusnet:

1. Backend & OOP Automation Mastery:
    Leveraging deep Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and C#, I designed the "Vortex AI" engine to execute transactions with <50ms latency. I have validated these high-speed operations ensuring race-condition handling—skills directly transferable to complex iGaming backend systems.

2. Advanced Automation Frameworks (Playwright & TypeScript):
    I developed "Q-Allright", a custom QA framework wrapper around Playwright that utilizes AI agents to detect and "self-heal" broken test selectors in real-time. This reduces maintenance overhead by over 90%, allowing for faster release cycles.

3. Enterprise-Grade CI/CD & Security:
    I do not simply run tests locally. I have implemented secure SLSA Level 1 compliant pipelines using GitHub Actions and Docker. My infrastructure is essentially "Cloud-Agnostic" and is monitored 24/7 by Datadog, ensuring observability and rapid incident response.

4. Leadership & Mentorship:
    As a Solo Architect delivering the output of a full team, I have established strict coding standards, documentation practices, and architectural patterns. I am ready to mentor junior team members and introduce these efficiency-multiplying methodologies to your existing squads.

My goal is to bring this level of autonomy, rigorous testing, and architectural discipline to Amusnet. I am ready to integrate into your remote team immediately and start optimizing your testing pipelines.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my technical background can support Amusnet’s continued growth.

Sincerely,

Dimitar Prodromov
Systems Architect & QA Lead
