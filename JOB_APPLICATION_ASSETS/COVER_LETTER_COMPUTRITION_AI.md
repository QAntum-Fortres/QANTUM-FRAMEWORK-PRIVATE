POSITION: Lead Software Engineer (.NET/AWS)

**RE: ACCELERATING YOUR ROADMAP WITH AN "AI-FIRST" ARCHITECH**

Dear Hiring Team,

I read your job description for the **Lead Software Engineer** role, and one line stood out immediately: **"Safely apply AI tools... to accelerate delivery."**

Most candidates will apply offering you "7 years of C# experience." I am offering you something different: **The Future of Engineering.**

I am an Architect who has spent the last year building **"The Pantheon"** — a proprietary autonomous development engine that allows me to operate with the output of a 5-person team. I don't just "write" .NET code; I architect the solution, define the security interaction boundaries, and then orchestrate AI agents to generate the boilerplate, unit tests, and documentation.

**Why I am the Strategic Fit for Computrition:**

**1. AI Mastery (The Multiplier Effect):**
You want a Lead who can "raise the bar." I bring an "AI-First" methodology that ensures every Pull Request is pre-analyzed for security flaws, every method has unit tests generated instantly, and documentation is never out of date. I can mentor your team to use these tools **safely**, ensuring no PHI ever leaks into a public model.

**2. HIPAA-Grade Security Mindset:**
My background is in **high-frequency algorithmic trading**. In my world, a security flaw doesn't just mean a ticket in JIRA; it means instant financial ruin. I built `ReaperAudit`, an immutable logging system that tracks every system action. This "paranoia" is exactly what you need when handling **Patient Health Information (PHI)**. I understand *Encryption in Transit*, *Encryption at Rest*, and *Least Privilege Identity Management* because I live by them.

**3. .NET & Cloud Architecture:**
I design systems that scale. Whether it's managing AWS Lambda event triggers or optimizing PostgreSQL schemas for complex data models, I focus on **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID principles**. I ensure the domain logic is decoupled from the infrastructure, making the system testable and maintainable for years to come.

**4. Leadership & Mentorship:**
A true leader empowers their team. I don't hoard knowledge; I build systems and documentation that allow a junior engineer to push code with the confidence of a senior. I want to help Computrition's engineering team transition from "coding hard" to "coding smart."

I am ready to bring my **Arsenal** of efficiency tools and my security-first mindset to Computrition. Let's build the platform that powers the future of healthcare nutrition.

Sincerely,

**Dimitar Prodromov**
*The AI-Augmented Architect*
