            Sofia, Bulgaria<br>
            Senior Backend Engineer

        To the Talent Acquisition Team,<br>
        Patrianna LTD
    </div>

    <p>
        I am writing to express my strong interest in the <strong>Senior Java Engineer</strong> position at Patrianna
        LTD. Having worked in the core engineering teams at <strong>DraftKings</strong>, I understand the unique
        adrenaline and technical rigor required to build global social gaming platforms that serve 150 million
        customers.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have read your requirements carefully, and I want to address the "elephant in the room" upfront: my recent
        production experience has been heavily focused on <strong>C# (.NET Core)</strong> and <strong>TypeScript/Node.js
            Environment</strong> rather than pure Java. However, I am applying because I am a <strong>Polyglot
            Engineer</strong> who believes that while languages are tools, <em>Architecture is universal</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        My expertise aligns perfectly with the architectural DNA of Patrianna's platform:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>High-Load & Concurrency:</strong> At DraftKings, and in my recent R&D work on High-Frequency Trading
            engines, I have solved the exact scalability challenges you face—race conditions, millisecond latency
            requirements, and massive fan-out of WebSocket events. I understand that whether you use Java's
            <code>Reactor</code> or Node's <code>Worker Threads</code>, the principles of non-blocking I/O remain the
            same.</li>

        <li><strong>Event-Driven Systems:</strong> I live and breathe complex ecosystem integrations. From orchestrating
            Docker Swarms to managing message consistency across distributed services, I build systems that are designed
            to fail gracefully and recover automatically—a necessity for any 24/7 gaming platform.</li>

        <li><strong>Domain Knowledge:</strong> Unlike a generic developer, I don't need to be taught what a "bet slip"
            is, how wallet transactions must be atomic, or why latency kills user engagement during a live game. I hit
            the ground running with industry context.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I am confident that my deep understanding of <strong>Object-Oriented Design patterns</strong>,
        <strong>SQL/PostgreSQL optimization</strong>, and <strong>Multithreading</strong> will allow me to transition to
        your Java 24 / Spring Boot stack effectively within weeks, not months.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am eager to bring my "High-Load" mindset to Patrianna and contribute to the next generation of social
        entertainment. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in gaming architecture can deliver
        immediate value to your rapidly expanding team.
