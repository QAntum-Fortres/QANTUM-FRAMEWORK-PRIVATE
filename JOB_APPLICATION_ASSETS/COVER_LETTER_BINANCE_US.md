RE: APPLICATION FOR QA ANALYST - FROM A BUILDER OF BINANCE BOTS

Dear Hiring Team,

Most candidates applying for your **QA Analyst** role will tell you they have "tested functionality." I am writing to tell you that **I have programmatically traded on your platform** because I built the bots that do it.

I am an Automation Architect and the creator of **"The Reaper Engine"** — a proprietary algorithmic trading system designed specifically to execute high-frequency trades on Binance using the `ccxt` library and your public/private API endpoints.

I am applying because I don't just understand "Software Quality"; I understand **Financial Integrity**, **Order Execution Latency**, and **API Rate Limits** (HTTP 429 is my old friend).

**Why I am the "God Mode" candidate for this role:**

**1. I Know Your API Better Than the Docs:**
While building my `ReaperEngine.ts`, I laid the groundwork for robust API testing logic. I validated WebSocket stream stability for `BTC/USDT` updates and ensured my internal ledger (`VORTEX_TRADES.csv`) perfectly matched the exchange's execution reports. I know exactly how critical "data consistency" is in a fintech environment.

**2. I Automate the Un-Automatable (Self-Healing QA):**
You use JIRA? I built **"ReaperAudit"** and **"Q-Allright"**. The latter is a Playwright-based framework wrapped in AI agents that detects broken selectors and *fixes the code itself* in real-time. I can bring this "Self-Healing" methodology to the Binance.US regression suite, drastically reducing maintenance time.

**3. Fintech Paranoia (Security First):**
I approach testing with a "Zero Trust" mindset. My system is SLSA Level 1 compliant, secured by hardware-bound keys, and monitored by Datadog. I understand that in crypto, a bug isn't just an error — it's a loss of user funds. I test with that weight on my shoulders.

**4. Remote-First & Global:**
I have built my entire ecosystem remotely, managing deployment, monitoring, and development across a distributed node network. I thrive in async environments and communicate with the precision of a system log.

I am overqualified for a standard "Analyst" role, but I want to work with **the best**. Binance.US is the standard. I am ready to bring my entire "Arsenal" of tools, scripts, and automation strategies to your team immediately.

Let’s ensure the bridge to financial freedom is bug-free.

Sincerely,

**Dimitar Prodromov**
*The Architect of QAntum*
